# JTStudio!

## The name and the story

This app allows for account creation and collaborative effort within a game development team.
Presenting features to the team such as creation and presentation of game ideas with details within those ideas.
Each member can view and like the ideas from their team members and idea creators can edit or delete ideas if they like to.
The idea for this app comes from my own passion for gaming plus the ideas that spark game creation/development as a whole.
Creating this app it felt like it would be a nice way for a team to collab on ideas and get a bit of feedback from fellow team devs on presented game ideas.
